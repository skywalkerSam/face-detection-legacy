# Project: [face-detection](https://github.com/skywalkerSam/face-detection-legacy)

A simple `face-detection` application using `clarifai`. This project is made with `create-react-app`, and deployed on `github-pages`, and it works. [Here...](https://skywalkersam.github.io/face-detection-legacy/)


```shell
npx create-react-app face-detection-legacy
```
```shell
npm start
```


- Under Development!

- Moved from `REST` to `gRPC`


## Standalone frontend won't work, API calls moved to the backend for better security

- Using `render` for backend deployment
- `Netlify` for frontend


`NOTE`: For some unknown reasons, the first response from the backend server is too slow ( 7.4s ).




## Until next time...

# ;)
