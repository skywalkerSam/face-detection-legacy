# Project: [face-detection](https://github.com/skywalkerSam/face-detection)

A simple face-detection application using clarifai.

- Deployed on `GitHub` using `gh-pages`, [here...](https://skywalkersam.github.io/face-detection/)

- Moved from `REST` to `gRPC`

- Frontend alone won't work, API calls moved to the backend for security concerns!


## Until next time...
