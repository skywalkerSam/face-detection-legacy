# Project: [face-detection](https://github.com/skywalkerSam/face-detection-legacy)

A simple `face-detection` application using `clarifai`. This project is made with `create-react-app`, and deployed on `github-pages`, and it works. [Here...](https://skywalkersam.github.io/face-detection-legacy/)


```shell
npx create-react-app face-detection-legacy
```


- Under Development!

- Moved from `REST` to `gRPC`


## Standalone frontend won't work, API calls moved to the backend for better security

- Using `render` for backend deployment


`NOTE`: For reasons unknown, I'm unable to deploy it on `Netlify`, and the response from the backend is very slow ( 7.4s ). So, I'm trying to build it again with `vite`, and deploy it on Netlify, or some other platform. Do some optimization n' stuff. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it won't be receiving any updates in the future because, i think that `create-react-app` was a mistake. Using `vite` from now on...




## Until next time...
